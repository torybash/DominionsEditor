With knowledge of this ritual, the Death mage has discovered how to remove the viscera of another necromancer, making him immortal. The casting mage performs the ritual of Lichcraft on a willing necromancer in return for his eternal servitude. The subject is then transformed into an immortal being of great magical power known as a Lich. By removing the viscera of the target and hiding it, the caster can ensure the immortality and loyalty of the subject. Should the body of the Lich be physically destroyed, a new one is formed from the dust of dead humans.
