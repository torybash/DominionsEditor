The caster opens an arcane portal between his current position and another province. Any number of troops may enter the portal in either direction. The portal will last for one season unless the caster uses extra gems to enhance the duration. Each extra gem spent increases the duration by one season. The forming portal will be noticed by the people of the targeted land and enemy spies and armies might sneak through.
