This magic mirror is cracked by the tension between the Astral magic used to forge the mirror and the magic from the bloodsoaked frame. If brought to battle, the mirror will instantly dispel any illusions and phantasms at the cost of making its user somewhat vulnerable to enemy magic. But the real power of the mirror can only be unlocked by an Astral mage: The ability to destroy other people's minds from faraway lands.
