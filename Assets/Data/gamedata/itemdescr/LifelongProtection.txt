The Blood mage sacrifices twoscore slaves to get the attention of Infernal powers. When contact is made, a powerful demon will offer a contract, to be signed in blood. Whoever signs his name to the contract will be protected in battle by a never-ending horde of imps for as long as he lives. In exchange for this fair and valuable consideration, he agrees to transfer his soul to the demon when the contract ends.
